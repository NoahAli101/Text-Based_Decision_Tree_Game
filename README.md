1.This project demonstrates the creation of a basic text-based decision tree game. Players start with a scenario and make choices (e.g., left or right) that lead to different branches of the story. The game is implemented in Python without using external libraries.

2.Requirements
Python 3.x
The game does not require any external libraries or dependencies.

3.Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
--bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-game.git
-Navigate to the project directory.
--bash
cd decision-tree-game

4.Usage
Open the decision_tree_game.py file in a text editor.
Run the script to start the text-based decision tree game.

--bash
python decision_tree_game.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to make choices and progress through the story.

5.Features
Engage in a text-based adventure game where choices affect the outcome.
Utilize a binary decision tree structure to navigate different storylines.

6.Customization
Customize the decision tree by modifying the storyline and choices in the DecisionTreeGame class.
Expand the game by adding more nodes to the decision tree for complex and varied narratives.

7.cknowledgments
This project is a simple demonstration of a text-based decision tree game and can serve as a foundation for more complex game development.
